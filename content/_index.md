# 👋🏽 Hey

<div class="home-container">

  <div class="home-content">

I'm Asnim. I work at [Sensibull](https://sensibull.com/) where I focus mainly on backend engineering.

I like to [tinker](https://github.com/asnimansari) with stuff around monitoring, networking and distributed systems.

When I'm not in the tech zone, I'm probably hitting gym, on a solo trip, or experimenting in the kitchen.
