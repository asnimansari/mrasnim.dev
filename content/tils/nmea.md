NMEA 0183 is a standard for electronic navigation devices between marine electronic devices such as GPS, autopilot, sonars and other instruments.

Though NMEA 2000 replaces 0183, 0183 is still widely used.

I found an interesting Rust repo which parses NMEA 0183 Sentences [AeroRust/nmea](https://github.com/AeroRust/nmea)
