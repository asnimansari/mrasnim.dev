# Bali Fitness Vacation with Kris (11th - 18th October 2024)

On one casual day at the gym, I was talking to my gym trainer Kris:
_"Hey Kris, I am thinking of taking a vacation and going somewhere to chill."_
Kris said he hadn't taken a vacation recently, so why not go somewhere together? That was the start of the plan.

Our initial idea was to pick [Kuari Pass Trek](https://indiahikes.com/kuari-pass) or [Hampta Pass Trek](https://indiahikes.com/hampta-pass), but as we researched further, we realized that the cost and effort required for these treks were similar to doing a fitness vacation in Bali. Besides, Kris had done this twice before and promised me I would have a fun time. After looking at my work schedule, I decided to go the same day we planned it.

It was a six-and-a-half-day vacation. The broader agenda was to do three workouts a day, eat clean, and rest, which is exactly what we did.

## Itinerary

### **Day 1 - Friday, 11th October 2024**

We landed at Bali DPS airport, took a taxi, and went straight to [Sepeda Hostel Canggu](https://sepedahostel.com/), where we stayed for the entire trip. It was a fun and affordable hostel, costing around ₹11K for two people for seven days.

- Had dinner at a nearby Korean BBQ restaurant serving unlimited meals.
- Walked around the Canggu area to check out gyms we wanted to visit.
- Ended the day with a protein smoothie and an Acai bowl at a nearby place.

---

### **Day 2 - Saturday, 12th October 2024**

- Joined the **Flowerboy Run**, a 5K run starting from a nearby café. The rough terrain made it challenging, and I couldn’t finish the entire run.
- Went for our first session at **Wanderlust Fitness Village**. The Saturday workout was intense, with a mix of full-body barbell exercises and 800-meter runs in the sun. I gave up after the first round, but Kris powered through.
- Protein shakes at Wanderlust were delicious, so I skipped lunch.
- In the evening, had dinner at [Milk &amp; Madu](https://www.milkandmadu.com/), where I had a burger, and Kris opted for a large salad.

### **Day 3 - Sunday, 13th October 2024**

- Early morning start for the **Mt. Batur Hike**, which involved climbing 1.7 km in about 2-2.5 hours to see a stunning sunrise near an active volcano.
- Our companions were a couple from Gujarat; the husband gave up halfway and took a motorcycle ride up.
- Kris and I had deep conversations while descending, discussing past adventures and life goals.
- Learned about the opportunity to shoot an RPG at specific targets in Cambodia.

---

### **Day 4 - Monday, 14th October 2024**

- Did **two workouts at Wanderlust Fitness Village**:
  - Early morning session with barbell exercises like cleans and jerks.
  - A second session mid-morning, which was equally intense.
- Had breakfast at [The BrunchClub Berawa](https://brunchclubbali.com/), which served amazing food.
- Spent the evening on a long walk and had dinner at a traditional **Warung**.
- Participated in a beer pong game (without beer) organized by the hostel and won (beginners' luck)!

---

### **Day 5 - Tuesday, 15th October 2024**

- Joined the **Rise and Run** running club, led by a Tasmanian lady. Started the run from **Crate Café** and completed a 5K run.
- Had breakfast at **Avocado Factory**, which served amazing avocado-based dishes.
- Attended a Spin class at Zyn, followed by protein shakes at their café.
- Evening workout at **Obsidian Gym**, which had impressive equipment and a global crowd.
- Dinner at **Santorini Greek Restaurant**.

---

### **Day 6 - Wednesday, 16th October 2024**

- Morning full-body workout at **Wanderlust Fitness Village**, followed by a fantastic meal at **Motion Café**.
- Afternoon session at **Canggu Studio**, where Coach Douglass taught us Callisthenics.

---

### **Day 7 - Thursday, 17th October 2024**

- No workouts planned. In the evening, Kris and I visited a nearby beach (because a trip to Bali without a beach visit would be incomplete).
- Had dinner at a **Canggu Superfood** place, though it wasn’t as great as the other spots we tried.

---

### **Day 8 - Friday, 18th October 2024**

- Bid farewell to Kris as he headed back to India.
- I continued with my solo explorations in Bali.

## Reflection

This trip was an incredible blend of fitness, adventure, and meaningful conversations. It was my first trek ever, and the bond I formed with Kris during this trip made it all the more special.
