Compared to 2023, 2024 was a highly satisfactory in terms of what I acheived.

The only major thing I wanted to achieve was get into good shape and mood, ended up doing multiple stuff.

This is the list I can think...

1. Bulit a habit of regularly working out and getting FOMO when a session is missed.
2. Eating clean.
3. Helped 4 freshers to land on software jobs.
4. Trying to meet people whom I feel are dear to me irrespective of who their response.
5. Finished the commitment of sponsoring 4 year education of someone from college.
6. Did a vacation to Japan with my wife.
7. Did a roadtrip in Georgia with my boss.
8. Did a fitness vaction with my gym trainer Kris, and did Mt Batur Hike
9. Talked to a hell lot of people and improved my communatiomn skills.
10. Got a health insurance for me and my wife.
11. Made promises on things I was confident I could deliver and fulfilled those.
