I have been an avide fan of Guacamole for a long time. I have never made it home until yesterday.

This time I was just keen to try it out as I didn't want to eat out.

The recipe is pretty simple.

I used to the following recipe.

1. 1 Avocado (Vietnamese)
2. 1/2 Medium Onion
3. 1/2 Tomato without seeds
4. 2 chillies
5. 1/2 Lime
6. 1/2 tsp Salt

I didn't have Cilantro to add, so skipped it. Adding Cilantro should make it more flavorful.

Mash the avocado and add the rest of the ingredients. Give it a good mix.

Use Nachos/Doritos to serve it.
