        <content type="html" xml:base="https://mrasnim.dev/posts/hitting-gym/">&lt;p&gt;From 2018 to 2023, the lion’s share of my time went into developing various products and features at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sensibull.com&quot;&gt;sensibull.com&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I barely used to walk, binge eat whatever I wanted, and ate a tonne of sugar items. Being in Bangalore, everything was available at doorsteps.
This eventually took a toll on my physical and mental health.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2024, beginning work slowed down, and I was able to free up a lot of time for my personal needs. I thought to make use of this time
to regain control over my physical and mental health.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried basic Yoga, the Couch to 5K program, etc., before, but I didn’t enjoy any of those much. I have also tried hitting a gym in Bangalore and hiring a Personal Trainer, but that also didn’t quite work well for me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to figure out what I wanted to do regarding fitness and arrived at an understanding…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to avoid hitting a fitness goal but to build a habit.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn’t want to work out alone (at least in the early stage) but rather engage in a community of like-minded people who were striving to be fit.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to eat out less and less from outside and eat more unprocessed food.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After extensive research, I randomly stumbled upon &lt;code&gt;Parkway Fitness&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, a gym based out of Kochi, Kerala, where there were group fitness classes
organised by two people, Kris and Sandra. It was a wow moment for me as I had always been fascinated by living in Kochi for a while.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things I wanted to ensure was&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatever it takes, go to the gym every day for the first 6 months unless there is some emergency.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat clean&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do 1, I rented out a place 250 meters away from the gym so that I wouldn’t make any excuses to myself, like traffic or being late, etc. I could go to the gym just by walking
To hit 2, I signed up with a health meal service available locally and subscribed to all the meals from them. This ensured I didn’t have to go to a hotel to get food.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since May 1st, I have been regularly hitting the gym, meeting my protein and nutrient requirements, and eventually, I started seeing noticeable results in both my body and my mind.
This has an immense effect on my overall mood and happiness, which I never had before.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do strength training thrice a week and functional movement exercises twice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, If I miss a day, I get FOMO.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
