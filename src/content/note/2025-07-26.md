This was a less eventful week:

1. My grandmom passed away at the beginning of the week.  
2. As a result, I missed the Monday and Tuesday gym sessions.  
3. However, I managed to complete all the strength training workouts by Saturday.  
4. Swimming has been progressing well — I’ve started incorporating hand movements.  
5. I rejoined work at [Sensibull.com](https://sensibull.com) and resumed tinkering with bug fixes.  
6. After recommending *[Losing My Virginity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13042724-losing-my-virginity)* by **Richard Branson**, to Mariyam. I’ve started reading it again for the third time.  
7. Tinkered with [Endel](https://endel.io), an AI-based focus music website recommended by Anzal.  
8. Tried out [SuperClaude](https://github.com/SuperClaude-Org/SuperClaude_Framework) for AI-driven coding workflows.
9. Riya went for her first Mumbai trip with her friends. So it was just me and my computer here for the weekend.
