## Sabbatical

Taking off from work was one of the best decisions I made in 2025. 

I started my off period from the 1st week of May to the 3rd week of July. These were the fastest going days in my life recently.

I picked up a few new things during this period, like..

1. Went for Hyrox style training with Kris (I would like to emphasise that these days were my dead days).
2. Picked up swimming inspired by Riya and seeing pebble beaches in Turkey.
3. Finished a couple of books:
   - [The Mom Test](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52283963-the-mom-test) by Rob Fitzpatrick, recommended by Anzal.
   - [Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years at Lockheed](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101438.Skunk_Works) by Leo Janos, Ben R. Rich.
   - [The Forty Rules of Love](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6642715-the-forty-rules-of-love) by Elif Shafak, recommended by Mariyam.
   - [Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223436601-careless-people) by Sarah Wynn-Williams, another recommendation from Mariyam.
   - [The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/171681821-the-anxious-generation) by Jonathan Haidt.

4. Did a trip to Turkey with Riya.
5. Did a solo trip covering a few courts and the countryside of Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Germany (Munich).
6. Did a full day trek to Zugspitze, the top of Germany, 2964m above sea level.
7. Numerous intellectual masturbation sessions with Abhiram about the following product we are planning to build together.
8. Started Building new lego/brick sets.



I burnt a hole in my pocket during these three months. But it was worth it after 6.5 years of continuous work.


    I wish I were a cow doing Moo Moo in the Austrian Alps.
