<p>On one casual day at the gym, I was talking to my gym trainer Kris:
<em>“Hey Kris, I am thinking of taking a vacation and going somewhere to chill.”</em>
Kris said he hadn’t taken a vacation recently, so why not go somewhere together? That was the start of the plan.</p>
<p>Our initial idea was to pick <a href="https://indiahikes.com/kuari-pass">Kuari Pass Trek</a> or <a href="https://indiahikes.com/hampta-pass">Hampta Pass Trek</a>, but as we researched further, we realized that the cost and effort required for these treks were similar to doing a fitness vacation in Bali. Besides, Kris had done this twice before and promised me I would have a fun time. After looking at my work schedule, I decided to go the same day we planned it.</p>
<p>It was a six-and-a-half-day vacation. The broader agenda was to do three workouts a day, eat clean, and rest, which is exactly what we did.</p>

<h3 id="day-1-friday-11th-october-2024"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#day-1-friday-11th-october-2024" aria-label="Anchor link for: day-1-friday-11th-october-2024">🔗</a><strong>Day 1 - Friday, 11th October 2024</strong></h3>
<p>We landed at Bali DPS airport, took a taxi, and went straight to <a href="https://sepedahostel.com/">Sepeda Hostel Canggu</a>, where we stayed for the entire trip. It was a fun and affordable hostel, costing around ₹11K for two people for seven days.</p>
<ul>
<li>Had dinner at a nearby Korean BBQ restaurant serving unlimited meals.</li>
<li>Walked around the Canggu area to check out gyms we wanted to visit.</li>
<li>Ended the day with a protein smoothie and an Acai bowl at a nearby place.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-2-saturday-12th-october-2024"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#day-2-saturday-12th-october-2024" aria-label="Anchor link for: day-2-saturday-12th-october-2024">🔗</a><strong>Day 2 - Saturday, 12th October 2024</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Joined the <strong>Flowerboy Run</strong>, a 5K run starting from a nearby café. The rough terrain made it challenging, and I couldn’t finish the entire run.</li>
<li>Went for our first session at <strong>Wanderlust Fitness Village</strong>. The Saturday workout was intense, with a mix of full-body barbell exercises and 800-meter runs in the sun. I gave up after the first round, but Kris powered through.</li>
<li>Protein shakes at Wanderlust were delicious, so I skipped lunch.</li>
<li>In the evening, had dinner at <a href="https://www.milkandmadu.com/">Milk &amp; Madu</a>, where I had a burger, and Kris opted for a large salad.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Early morning start for the <strong>Mt. Batur Hike</strong>, which involved climbing 1.7 km in about 2-2.5 hours to see a stunning sunrise near an active volcano.</li>
<li>Our companions were a couple from Gujarat; the husband gave up halfway and took a motorcycle ride up.</li>
<li>Kris and I had deep conversations while descending, discussing past adventures and life goals.</li>
<li>Learned about the opportunity to shoot an RPG at specific targets in Cambodia.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Did <strong>two workouts at Wanderlust Fitness Village</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Early morning session with barbell exercises like cleans and jerks.</li>
<li>A second session mid-morning, which was equally intense.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Had breakfast at <a href="https://brunchclubbali.com/">The BrunchClub Berawa</a>, which served amazing food.</li>
<li>Spent the evening on a long walk and had dinner at a traditional <strong>Warung</strong>.</li>
<li>Participated in a beer pong game (without beer) organized by the hostel and won (beginners’ luck)!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>No workouts planned. In the evening, Kris and I visited a nearby beach (because a trip to Bali without a beach visit would be incomplete).</li>
<li>Had dinner at a <strong>Canggu Superfood</strong> place, though it wasn’t as great as the other spots we tried.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<p>This trip was an incredible blend of fitness, adventure, and meaningful conversations. It was my first trek ever, and the bond I formed with Kris during this trip made it all the more special.</p>
