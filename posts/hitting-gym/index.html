    <p>From 2018 to 2023, the lion’s share of my time went into developing various products and features at <a href="https://sensibull.com">sensibull.com</a>.</p>
<p>I barely used to walk, binge eat whatever I wanted, and ate a tonne of sugar items. Being in Bangalore, everything was available at doorsteps.
This eventually took a toll on my physical and mental health.</p>
<p>By 2024, beginning work slowed down, and I was able to free up a lot of time for my personal needs. I thought to make use of this time
to regain control over my physical and mental health.</p>
<p>I have tried basic Yoga, the Couch to 5K program, etc., before, but I didn’t enjoy any of those much. I have also tried hitting a gym in Bangalore and hiring a Personal Trainer, but that also didn’t quite work well for me.</p>
<p>I tried to figure out what I wanted to do regarding fitness and arrived at an understanding…</p>
<ol>
<li>I wanted to avoid hitting a fitness goal but to build a habit.</li>
<li>I didn’t want to work out alone (at least in the early stage) but rather engage in a community of like-minded people who were striving to be fit.</li>
<li>I wanted to eat out less and less from outside and eat more unprocessed food.</li>
</ol>
<p>After extensive research, I randomly stumbled upon <code>Parkway Fitness</code>, a gym based out of Kochi, Kerala, where there were group fitness classes
organised by two people, Kris and Sandra. It was a wow moment for me as I had always been fascinated by living in Kochi for a while.</p>
<p>Two things I wanted to ensure was</p>
<ol>
<li>Whatever it takes, go to the gym every day for the first 6 months unless there is some emergency.</li>
<li>Eat clean</li>
</ol>
<p>To do 1, I rented out a place 250 meters away from the gym so that I wouldn’t make any excuses to myself, like traffic or being late, etc. I could go to the gym just by walking
To hit 2, I signed up with a health meal service available locally and subscribed to all the meals from them. This ensured I didn’t have to go to a hotel to get food.</p>
<p>Since May 1st, I have been regularly hitting the gym, meeting my protein and nutrient requirements, and eventually, I started seeing noticeable results in both my body and my mind.
This has an immense effect on my overall mood and happiness, which I never had before.</p>
<p>I do strength training thrice a week and functional movement exercises twice.</p>
<p>Now, If I miss a day, I get FOMO.</p>
